"""
To start, we will generate a random integer between 1 and 20, and
based on the result of the randomnumber, we check to see if it falls under certain range
if the number id greater than 15, then the result will be "Cherries"
otherwise if the number is >10, then the result will be "Orange"
otherwise if the number is >5, then the result will be "Plum"
otherwise if the number is >2, then the result will be "Melon"
otherwise if the number is >1, then the result will be "Bell"
otherwise the number is not any of the above,then the result will be "Bar"

we iterate over using a loop three times and print the result to the user.As and example "Plum Cherries Melon"
